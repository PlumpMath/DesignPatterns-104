# DesignPatterns
Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

Creational Patterns
Abstract Factory -	Creates an instance of several families of classes
Builder	- Separates object construction from its representation
Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist
